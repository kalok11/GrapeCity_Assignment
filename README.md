# GrapeCity_Assignment

-> It is an Assignment where I have to make a TIP Calculator which can do function like:-

The application should provide option for the user to specify

o Bill amount

o Tip percentage

o Number of people

â€¢ Based on the above inputs the application should display

o Tip amount to be paid per person

o Total amount to be paid per person

I have used JavaScript for the coding part and HTML and CSS for UI part.

-> In js I have made a  function tipCalculator() in which I called all the values from input tag in HTML by using
'document.getElementById()' and saved there value in a variable.

-> Then I wrote the Exception handler if the values are not provided or if wrong data type in given , it will detect
and will show the pop msg regarding the error.

-> Then I wrote the Calculation part where all the function of the calculator will be done.

-> After that I called back the function tipCalculator() when the Calculate Button is clicked by using the onclick function.

-> Then the result will be declared at the bottom of the Tip Calculator.

# Also I have added the PDF file for the Test Cases for the Tip Calculator Application.
